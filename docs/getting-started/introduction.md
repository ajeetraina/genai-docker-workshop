# Introduction to GenAI with Docker

## What is GenAI?

Generative AI (GenAI) refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content, including text, images, audio, and more. These systems are trained on vast amounts of data and learn patterns that allow them to create outputs that resemble human-created content.

Key aspects of GenAI include:

- **Content generation**: Creating new text, images, code, or other media
- **Pattern recognition**: Learning from existing data to generate relevant outputs
- **Contextual understanding**: Responding appropriately to prompts or instructions
- **Creative applications**: Assisting with writing, design, programming, and more

## Why Docker for GenAI?

Docker provides an ideal platform for deploying and managing GenAI applications for several reasons:

1. **Consistency**: Docker ensures that your AI models run the same way across all environments.
2. **Isolation**: Containerized AI models are isolated from other applications, preventing conflicts.
3. **Scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale your GenAI applications up or down based on demand.
4. **Dependency Management**: Docker containers include all necessary dependencies, eliminating "it works on my machine" problems.
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight compared to traditional VMs, making better use of your infrastructure.
6. **Orchestration**: With Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, you can orchestrate complex GenAI deployments.

## Docker Components for GenAI

Docker provides several tools specialized for GenAI workloads:

- **Model Runner**: An optimized runtime for deploying and serving AI models
- **MCP Toolkit**: Docker tools for managing machine learning container platforms
- **Docker Hub for AI Models**: Repository of pre-built AI model containers

## Workshop Overview

This workshop will guide you through:

1. Setting up your environment for GenAI development with Docker
2. Understanding the architecture of containerized GenAI applications
3. Working with Model Runner for efficient model deployment
4. Implementing common GenAI use cases with Docker
5. Deploying and monitoring GenAI applications in production

Let's get started by ensuring you have all the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) in place!
