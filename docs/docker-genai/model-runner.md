docker pull docker/genai-model-runner:latest

# Run a model with Model Runner
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  --gpus all \
  -v /path/to/models:/models \
  docker/genai-model-runner:latest \
  --model-name "llama2-7b" \
  --model-path "/models/llama2-7b"
```

### Advanced Configuration

Model Runner offers numerous configuration options:

```bash
# Run with advanced configuration
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  --gpus all \
  -v /path/to/models:/models \
  -e MAX_BATCH_SIZE=8 \
  -e DYNAMIC_BATCHING=true \
  -e QUANTIZATION=int8 \
  -e MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=32 \
  docker/genai-model-runner:latest \
  --model-name "llama2-7b" \
  --model-path "/models/llama2-7b" \
  --max-seq-len 2048 \
  --enable-metrics
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Model Runner integrates well with Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: model-runner-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: model-runner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: model-runner
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: model-runner
        image: docker/genai-model-runner:latest
        args:
        - "--model-name=llama2-7b"
        - "--model-path=/models/llama2-7b"
        - "--enable-metrics"
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1
        volumeMounts:
        - name: model-volume
          mountPath: /models
      volumes:
      - name: model-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: model-pvc
```

## Performance Monitoring

Model Runner includes built-in monitoring capabilities:

### Metrics Exposed

- **Throughput**: Requests processed per second
- **Latency**: Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- **GPU Utilization**: Percentage of GPU capacity used
- **Memory Usage**: Model memory consumption
- **Queue Depth**: Number of requests waiting for processing

### Integration with Monitoring Tools

Model Runner metrics can be collected by:

- **Prometheus**: Direct scraping of exposed metrics
- **Grafana**: Visualization of performance data
- **Docker Desktop**: Integration with Docker metrics
- **Custom Solutions**: Via exposed API endpoints

## Best Practices for Model Runner

### Resource Allocation

- Start with resource settings recommended for your model size
- Monitor actual usage and adjust accordingly
- Consider dedicated instances for large models

### Performance Tuning

- Experiment with different batch sizes for your workload
- Test various quantization levels for your accuracy requirements
- Adjust concurrency settings based on request patterns

### Deployment Strategy

- Use rolling updates for model version changes
- Implement health checks for reliable operations
- Consider blue/green deployments for zero-downtime updates

In the next lab, we'll perform hands-on exercises with Model Runner to see these concepts in action.
