# MCP Toolkit

The Model Container Platform (MCP) Toolkit is Docker's comprehensive solution for managing the entire lifecycle of containerized AI models. It provides tools and frameworks to simplify the development, deployment, and management of GenAI applications.

## What is the MCP Toolkit?

The MCP Toolkit is a suite of tools designed to address the unique challenges of working with containerized AI models. It sits on top of Docker's core containerization technology and provides specialized capabilities for AI workloads.

Key aspects of the MCP Toolkit include:

- **Model Lifecycle Management**: Tools for managing models from development to retirement
- **Deployment Automation**: Streamlined workflows for deploying models to production
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent allocation and management of computing resources
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Comprehensive visibility into model performance
- **Integration Capabilities**: Connecting models with other systems and data sources

## Components of MCP Toolkit

### MCP CLI

The command-line interface for interacting with the MCP platform:

- **Model Management**: Commands for registering, updating, and deploying models
- **Environment Management**: Tools for configuring and managing deployment environments
- **Monitoring**: Commands for checking status and performance
- **Automation**: Scripting capabilities for workflow automation

### Model Registry

Central repository for managing model artifacts:

- **Version Control**: Tracking multiple versions of models
- **Metadata Management**: Storing and retrieving model metadata
- **Access Control**: Managing who can deploy or modify models
- **Dependency Tracking**: Managing relationships between models and dependencies

### Deployment Manager

Tools for deploying models to various environments:

- **Environment Templates**: Pre-configured environments for different model types
- **Scaling Policies**: Rules for automatically scaling model instances
- **Rolling Updates**: Zero-downtime updates of deployed models
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradual rollout of new model versions

### Resource Optimizer

Intelligent management of computing resources:

- **GPU Allocation**: Optimized allocation of GPU resources
- **Memory Management**: Efficient use of system memory
- **Cost Optimization**: Balancing performance and resource costs
- **Resource Sharing**: Maximizing utilization across multiple models

### Monitoring Framework

Comprehensive visibility into model operations:

- **Performance Metrics**: Tracking throughput, latency, and resource usage
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitoring the quality of model outputs
- **Alerting**: Notifications when metrics exceed thresholds
- **Visualization**: Dashboards for monitoring model performance

## Using the MCP Toolkit

### Basic Workflow

The typical workflow with MCP Toolkit includes:

1. **Model Registration**:
   ```bash
   mcp model register --name "gpt-model" --path ./model-artifacts --version 1.0
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   mcp environment create --name "production" --type gpu --resources "gpu=1,memory=32Gi"
   ```

3. **Model Deployment**:
   ```bash
   mcp deploy --model "gpt-model:1.0" --environment "production" --replicas 3
   ```

4. **Monitoring Deployment**:
   ```bash
   mcp status --deployment "gpt-model-production"
   ```

5. **Scaling Adjustment**:
   ```bash
   mcp scale --deployment "gpt-model-production" --replicas 5
   ```

### Advanced Features

#### A/B Testing

Setting up A/B testing between model versions:

```bash
mcp ab-test create \
  --name "gpt-model-test" \
  --modelA "gpt-model:1.0" \
  --modelB "gpt-model:1.1" \
  --traffic-split "80:20" \
  --environment "production"
```

#### Automated Workflows

Creating automated workflows for model updates:

```bash
mcp workflow create \
  --name "model-update-flow" \
  --steps "validate,deploy-canary,test-canary,deploy-full" \
  --model "gpt-model" \
  --environment "production"
```

#### Performance Profiling

Analyzing model performance for optimization:

```bash
mcp profile --deployment "gpt-model-production" --duration 30m
```

## Integration with Docker Ecosystem

The MCP Toolkit integrates seamlessly with the broader Docker ecosystem:

### Docker Compose Integration

Using Docker Compose with MCP:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  model-service:
    image: ${MCP_REGISTRY}/gpt-model:1.0
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
    environment:
      - MCP_MODEL_CONFIG=/configs/model-config.json
    volumes:
      - ./configs:/configs
```

### Kubernetes Integration

Deploying MCP-managed models to Kubernetes:

```bash
mcp kubernetes deploy \
  --model "gpt-model:1.0" \
  --namespace "ai-services" \
  --service-type LoadBalancer \
  --replicas 3
```

### CI/CD Integration

Integrating MCP with CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy Model
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install MCP CLI
        run: |
          curl -sL https://get.mcp.docker.com | bash
      - name: Deploy Model
        run: |
          mcp deploy --model "gpt-model:${{ github.sha }}" --environment "production"
```

## Best Practices for MCP Toolkit

### Organizational Structure

- **Model Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent naming for models and versions
- **Environment Separation**: Clearly separate development, testing, and production environments
- **Access Controls**: Implement appropriate permissions for different team roles

### Deployment Strategy

- **Incremental Rollouts**: Use canary or blue/green deployments for critical models
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests before full deployment
- **Rollback Planning**: Have clear procedures for rolling back problematic deployments

### Resource Management

- **Right-sizing Resources**: Allocate appropriate resources based on model requirements
- **Scaling Policies**: Set appropriate auto-scaling thresholds
- **Cost Monitoring**: Regularly review resource utilization and costs

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track both technical and business metrics
- **Regular Updates**: Keep models and dependencies up to date
- **Performance Optimization**: Regularly analyze and optimize model performance
