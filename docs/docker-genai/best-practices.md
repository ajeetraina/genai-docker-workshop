# Best Practices for GenAI with Docker

This page outlines best practices for deploying and managing GenAI applications using Docker.

## Development Best Practices

### Separate Development and Inference Environments

- **Use Multi-stage Builds**: Create separate build stages for development and inference
- **Development Container**: Include training libraries and debugging tools
- **Inference Container**: Streamlined with only necessary dependencies for production

```Dockerfile
# Development stage
FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.0.1-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime AS development
RUN pip install jupyter matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
# Add development tools

# Inference stage
FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.0.1-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime AS inference
COPY --from=development /app/model /app/model
# Only include inference requirements
```

### Efficient Model Management

- **Separate Model from Code**: Store models in volumes or object storage
- **Version Control for Models**: Use tagging and versioning for model artifacts
- **Model Registry**: Consider using a model registry like MLflow or Model Runner

### Development Workflow

- **Local Testing**: Test models locally before containerizing
- **Consistent Environments**: Use the same container for local development and CI/CD
- **Integration Testing**: Test the containerized model with realistic workloads

## Performance Optimization

### Container-Level Optimizations

- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate CPU, memory, and GPU limits
- **CPU Pinning**: Consider CPU pinning for critical workloads
- **NUMA Awareness**: For multi-socket servers, use NUMA-aware configurations

```bash
docker run --cpuset-cpus="0-3" --memory=8g --gpus device=0 my-genai-model
```

### Docker Storage Considerations

- **Choose Appropriate Storage Driver**: Consider overlay2 for better performance
- **Volume Mounting**: Use volumes for model storage rather than copying into containers
- **Tmpfs for Ephemeral Data**: Use tmpfs mounts for temporary data

### Network Optimization

- **Placement**: Place related services in the same Docker network
- **Bridge vs Host**: Consider host networking for maximum performance
- **Direct Container Communication**: Use Docker DNS for service discovery

## Deployment Strategies

### Scaling Approaches

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple container instances behind a load balancer
- **Auto-scaling**: Use orchestration platforms to scale based on metrics
- **Resource-based Scaling**: Scale based on CPU, memory, or GPU utilization

### High Availability

- **Health Checks**: Implement robust container health checks
- **Graceful Termination**: Handle SIGTERM properly for clean shutdowns
- **Rolling Updates**: Use rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments

### Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics Collection**: Export metrics from containers (Prometheus format)
- **Log Management**: Implement structured logging with consistent formats
- **Tracing**: Add distributed tracing for complex deployments

## Security Best Practices

### Container Security

- **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal or distroless base images
- **Non-root Users**: Run containers as non-root users
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Mount filesystems as read-only where possible

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Create a non-root user
RUN groupadd -r modeluser && useradd -r -g modeluser modeluser
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies and copy application
COPY --chown=modeluser:modeluser . .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Switch to non-root user
USER modeluser

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "serve_model.py"]
```

### Secrets Management

- **Environment Variables**: Avoid secrets in environment variables
- **Docker Secrets**: Use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets
- **Secret Management Tools**: Consider tools like HashiCorp Vault

### Image Security

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan images regularly
- **Content Trust**: Use Docker Content Trust for image signing
- **Registry Security**: Secure your Docker registry access

## GenAI-Specific Best Practices

### Model Optimization

- **Quantization**: Use quantized models when possible (INT8, FP16)
- **Model Pruning**: Remove unnecessary weights or layers
- **TensorRT/ONNX**: Convert models to optimized formats

### Serving Architecture

- **Batch Processing**: Implement batching for better throughput
- **Request Queuing**: Add queuing mechanisms for traffic spikes
- **Request Priority**: Implement priority queues for important requests

### Caching Strategies

- **Response Caching**: Cache common responses
- **Embedding Caching**: Cache embeddings for frequently accessed content
- **Tiered Caching**: Implement memory and disk-based caching

## Orchestration Best Practices

### Kubernetes for GenAI

- **Custom Resources**: Consider custom resources for model deployment
- **GPU Scheduling**: Configure proper GPU limits and scheduling
- **StatefulSets**: Use StatefulSets for stateful model servers

### Compose for Development

- **Development Environment**: Create comprehensive development environments
- **Service Definition**: Define all dependent services
- **Volume Mapping**: Map source code for rapid iteration

### Swarm for Simple Deployments

- **Overlay Networks**: Use overlay networks for multi-host deployments
- **Secrets Management**: Utilize Docker Swarm secrets
- **Rolling Updates**: Configure update policies for zero-downtime deployments

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you build reliable, efficient, and secure GenAI applications with Docker. The key is to:

1. Optimize for both development and production workflows
2. Carefully manage resources, especially GPU and memory
3. Implement proper security controls
4. Design for scalability and resilience
5. Monitor and observe system performance

By combining Docker's containerization capabilities with these GenAI-specific best practices, you can create deployments that are both powerful and maintainable.
